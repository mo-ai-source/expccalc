# expccalc

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a calculator for performing various arithmetic, logic, and floating-point operations on binary numbers.
## Features

- Perform integer arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Perform bitwise logic operations like AND, OR, and XOR.
- Perform unary operations such as negation, increment, decrement, and bit shifts.
- Perform floating-point arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) functionality.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the calculator.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. The code has been tested on MATLAB R2021a, but it should work with other versions as well.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
git clone https://github.com/mo-ai-source/expccalc.git

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. Open the `expccalc.m` file in MATLAB.

4. Run the `expccalc` function to launch the calculator GUI.

## Usage

The calculator GUI provides a user-friendly interface for performing various operations on binary numbers. Here are some key features:

- Enter binary numbers in the "Value A" and "Value B" fields.
- Use the buttons to perform arithmetic, logic, and floating-point operations.
- The result of the operation will be displayed in the "Output" field.
- The DAC and ADC functionality can be accessed using the corresponding buttons.
- The calculator also provides options to print the results and swap the input values.

For detailed information on each operation and its usage, refer to the comments in the code.
